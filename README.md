# DA-Project
In this project, I performed comprehensive data analysis to derive meaningful insights that help in decision-making processes. The key components of the analysis include:

Change-over-time analysis: I analyzed how various metrics evolved over a specific period, identifying trends and patterns in the data.

Cumulative analysis: I performed cumulative analysis to assess the total impact or growth over time, highlighting long-term progress and trends.

Data segmentation: I segmented the data into distinct groups, enabling deeper analysis and understanding of different customer segments, product categories, and other relevant dimensions.

Performance analysis: I conducted performance analysis to evaluate how well various components (such as products, teams, or strategies) performed based on key performance indicators (KPIs).

Part-to-whole analysis: I performed part-to-whole analysis to understand how individual components contribute to the overall outcome, helping to identify key drivers.

Customer and Product Reports: I created detailed reports to provide insights into customer behaviors and product performance, which can guide future business decisions.

This project helped to uncover actionable insights and provided a clearer view of the dataâ€™s impact on business performance.
